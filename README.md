# KillerSudokuHelper
Helps solve puzzles on dailykillersudoku.com

Copy this, open a web console on any dailykillersudoku puzzle, paste and press enter to see 1-9 x 45.

When you have more than one cage selected so that a sum appears in the site's helper box, Press 'm' to see that sum subtracted by all the 45 values.

This helps to quickly find odd-man-out values. The first value > 0 is emboldened.
